HI!

All my projects are under NDA, but this is a small C++ research project, where I try to solve
systems of quadratic polinomials by means of global optimisation of sum of squares.
I represent initial interval as a polyhedron and then cut away blocks which don't contain roots.

This code is far from perfect, but classes, presented here, allowed me to test many optimisation 
methods and get at least two approaches working.
